### 🌱 Project Overview

This project is a simple **landing page** created to represent one of my dreams — living close to nature.  
I’ve always believed that the peace, silence, and greenness of nature are things we all need to reconnect with.  
This page is a small reflection of that belief — a place to dream, breathe, and imagine life surrounded by the wild.
